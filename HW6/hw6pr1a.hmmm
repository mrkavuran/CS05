00 read r1 #Get number from user to r1
01 mul r2 r1 r1 #print the value of square of r1
02 mul r3 r2 r1 #print the value of mul. of r1 and r2
03 write r3 #print the value of cube of r1
04 addn r1 -1 #add -1 to r1
05 jeqzn r1 08 #if r1 equals to 0, jump to line 08
06 jgtzn r1 07 #if r1 greater than 0, jum to line 07
